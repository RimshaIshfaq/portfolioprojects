Hey guys, I am Rimsha Ishfaq. I am a last-semester student of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering at UET-Lahore. Here I will tell you about my first SQL project.

Introduction:
In data analysis, unraveling the stories hidden within vast datasets requires adept tools and methodologies. Amidst the global pandemic, understanding the trends of coronavirus-related data has become paramount. Using the wealth of publicly available data from ourworldindata.org, this article delves into a comprehensive exploration of coronavirus deaths and vaccinations through SQL.

By harnessing SQL’s querying capabilities, I embark on this journey to unearth patterns, correlations, and trends within the coronavirus data. Through this exploration, I aim to comprehend the current state of the pandemic and pave the way for informed strategies and interventions. Join me as I embark on this journey with SQL. SQL

Questions of Interest:
Here are the questions of interest:

· Which countries have the highest infection rates relative to their population size?

· What are the countries with the highest death count per population?

· How do death counts vary by continent?

· What is the Death percentage for COVID-19 in Pakistan and how does it change over time?

· What is the distribution of vaccinations globally, and how does it compare to the total population of each country?

I started the data cleaning process in Excel and used the filter function to make the work go faster. Now that the data was prepared, I could concentrate on choosing the most important indicators to examine. First, the overall number of COVID-19 cases and the associated death toll were compared.

I prioritized examining COVID-19 data specific to my country, Pakistan. To ascertain the likelihood of mortality following a COVID-19 infection, I embarked on a focused analysis.

Then, I looked at the countries with the highest infected rate as compared to their population. 


To look at the countries with the highest death count per population, 

To break things down by continent, I used the  code. This code will show the total death count for each continent.


Now looking at the global numbers. To look at the total cases and total deaths, along with their death percentage globally, I used the SQL code for this.


Finally, to assess the correlation between total population and vaccination coverage, I executed the SQL query.


Thank you for taking the time to review my project. I am open to any suggestions or feedback you may have.
